# Domestic-Violence-identification-models
	Use CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM+self-Attetion models to identify potential domestic violence(DV) crisis.
	Get posts about domestic violence on Facebook, label them with 1(DV exists) and 0(DV doesn't exist),cleaning and tokenization.
	Use Word2Vec to train them and generate the 50-dimensional embedding model.
	Use Keras to build all four models, train and assess them.
	Plot the training history.
