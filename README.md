# Domestic-Violence-identification-models
Use CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM+self-Attetion models to identify potential domestic violence(DV) crisis.  
Get posts about domestic violence on Facebook, label them with 1(DV exists) and 0(DV doesn't exist) into DV_dataset.xlsx.  
Use Word2Vec to train them and generate the 50-dimensional embedding model as dv_50.model.  
Use Keras to build all four models, train and assess them.  
Plot the training history.
